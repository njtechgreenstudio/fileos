# fileos
a simple file system is based on ext and using c++.It is comfortable for linux.

filesystem01.tar.gz is the best version of all.I write a simple makefile in it just for compiling easily.

#in dir filesytem

##if you want to run the whole project 'compile and create file',just input **make**.

##if you want to delete file,just input **make clean**.

##if you want to run file simply,just input **make run**.

##if you want to find back the usename and password of your file system,just input **make accountback**
